# exploras-agent

**This repository is entirely generated by AI under human instructions.**

✳️ An AI generative agent for extracting knowledge and generating content from **any epub book with a Table of Contents (TOC)**.
The provided example uses *Cloud-Native Ecosystems*, but the solution is applicable to any epub.

## Project Architecture

- **backend/**: Python services for extracting, generating, and orchestrating content (e.g., TOC extraction, AI calls, REST API) from any epub
- **frontend/**: User interface (UI) for asking questions about the book and viewing real-time AI-generated answers
- **samples/**: Example scripts and workflows (e.g., TOC extraction from epub, demo with Cloud-Native Ecosystems)
- **ebook/**: Archive of epub books (you can upload any epub with a TOC)
- **plugin/**: Integration plugins (e.g., WordPress)
- **.github/**: Workflows, prompts, and configuration



## Features

- Content generation via AI (GPT-4o)
- Output in Markdown and HTML
- TOC extraction and navigation from any epub
- WordPress REST API integration (in development)
- Web UI for Q&A on book topics
- GitHub Actions support


## How it works

1. The user uploads or selects an epub file (with TOC) via the web UI (frontend) and asks a question about the book.
2. The Python backend receives the question, extracts context from the selected epub, and generates an answer using AI.
3. The answer is returned in real time to the UI and can be saved or published.
4. All workflows and logic are orchestrated by Python services and AI-driven configuration.


## Note

This repository is created and maintained by AI (GitHub Copilot, GPT-4o, etc.) under human supervision and instructions. The solution is generic and applicable to any epub with a TOC.
